Dungeon-Crawler  

This project describes the development of a top-down dungeon crawler game designed using an object-oriented programming (OOP) architecture. 
The player progresses through a series of rooms containing enemies and simple puzzles with the objective of reaching the final area without losing all health; 
failure resets progress unless a final checkpoint has been unlocked. 

Core gameplay elements—including the player, enemies, and collectible items—are modeled as interacting objects that share common functionality through inheritance and polymorphism. 
Base classes encapsulate shared behaviors such as movement, collision detection, and health management, while specialized subclasses implement unique enemy behaviors and item effects, supporting modularity and extensibility. 

A structured testing methodology accompanies the design to ensure correctness and maintainability. 
Unit tests validate individual mechanics such as damage calculation, movement logic, and inventory handling, while integration tests verify interactions between systems, including combat, puzzle completion, and checkpoint persistence. 
Pygame is used strictly as a rendering and input layer, separating presentation from game logic, and simple 8-bit graphics and audio are intentionally employed to constrain scope and emphasize software architecture quality and verifiable behavior.
